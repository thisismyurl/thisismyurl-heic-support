A free non-destructive HEIC to WebP converter for WordPress: Auto-optimize new Apple device uploads with secure backups and 1-click restore. 

== Description ==


Free HEIC Optimizer by thisismyurl is a lightweight, high-performance utility designed to maximize your site speed without the need for expensive monthly subscriptions or external API keys.

Modern iOS devices capture images in HEIC/HEIF formats, which are often incompatible with web browsers. By converting these images to the modern WebP format, you can significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining high visual quality and broad compatibility.

This plugin is built with a Safety-First philosophy: every time an image is converted, the original HEIC file is archived in a secure backup folder. If you ever need to revert, a single click restores your original high-resolution file perfectly.


= Key Features =


100% Automatic: New HEIC and HEIF uploads are converted and optimized the moment they hit your Media Library.


Bulk Processing: Convert your existing library using an AJAX-powered tool that prevents server timeouts.


Non-Destructive Workflow: Original HEIC images are moved to /uploads/heic-backups/ for safe keeping.


Live Savings Report: View a real-time dashboard showing exactly how many megabytes of server space you have saved.


Individual & Bulk Restore: Undo changes for a single image or your entire library at any time.


GitHub Integrated: Features a built-in updater to ensure you always have the latest security and performance patches.

== Installation ==

Upload the thisismyurl-heic-support folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Navigate to Media > HEIC Support to access the dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this delete my original images? = No. It moves them to a backup folder within your uploads directory to ensure you never lose your original high-resolution files.


= Will my images break if I delete the plugin? = We recommend using the "Restore All" button in the dashboard before uninstallation. This reverts your site back to using your original images.


= Does this support HEIF formats? = Yes! The conversion engine handles both .heic and .heif files from modern smartphones.
